Python Challenge - Bootcamp Module #3

Introduction: 

In this challenge, we were tasked with applying our learnings from previous python classes to generate outputs and print to a text file. The learnings applied to generate the code and write the script include: storing empty lists, appending to empty lists, adding counter totals and aggregating counts using if statements in for loops.

PyBank: 

For the first assignment, most of the code was generated with the help of TA Geronimo during a tutoring session. He helped principally with the "pseudocode" and how best to formulate the variables and what I would need to generate the code. 

PyPoll: 

For the second assingment, for loops were used to append values to an empty list. The appended list was modified to a set to retrieve distinct values (candidate names.) From there, I created a "counter" variable and ran the for loop to aggregate every row.
